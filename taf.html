                    <h1>Frank Gailey Transient and Emergency Assistance Fund</h1>

                    <p>The Gailey Fund offers lodging and transportation assistance to travelers and community members in crisis situations. Being a donations-based fund, there is no guarantee that services will be available.</p>

                    <p>Primarily geared for one-time-only assistance to provide the client/s with time to muster resources to address the crisis, the program has a firm six-month wait policy. Individuals and households must wait at least six months before receiving assistance again.</p>

                    <h2>How to access the Gailey Fund in an Emergency</h2>

                    <p>Gailey Fund resources are currently accessed through a partnership with the Berea Police Department by contacting <a href="https://bereaky.gov/police/community-resource-coordinator/" target="_blank">Zinnia Hensley, the Community Resource Coordinator</a> during business hours.</p>

                    <p>After hours and on weekends, limited crisis-only assistance is available through the shift supervisors.</p>

                    <p>The police can be reached by calling the non-emergency number: 859-986-8456, or by using the direct line phone beside the police department window inside the entrance to City Hall  (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/212+Chestnut+St,+Berea,+KY+40403/@37.5698803,-84.2966265,17z" target="_blank">212 Chestnut Street</a>) on the parking lot side of the building when calling 911 is not appropriate for your situation.</p>




                    <h2>Who was Frank Gailey?</h2>

                    <p><img src="./images/FrankGailey.jpg" width="175" alt="Frank Gailey" style="float: left; margin: 6px; margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 0px; border: 2px solid #6b5d54;">Frank Gailey was an esteemed Biology professor at Berea College who never met a stranger, only new friends. He was passionate about many causes related to nature, science &amp; religion, and social justice. </p>

                    <p>Those who knew Frank speak of his generosity. He was known to carry silver dollars in his pocket in case he met someone who needed assistance, and to bring people home to stay with him if they needed somewhere to sleep. Those recalling stories of Frank get a special look in their eye as they remember their friend.</p>

                    <p>Several years ago he donated a sum of money to BFCO to establish this fund to continue his service and help people who were stranded in Berea. He envisioned a community fund that would help people get over a hump where a small amount of support would enable them to return to their community of choice. Frank’s idea was to help at times when only a little help was needed in order to prevent bigger problems for everybody.</p>
